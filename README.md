# Healthcare-Analysis

Project Overview
* This project analyzes a healthcare dataset to gain insights into various factors influencing patient care, resource allocation, and healthcare outcomes. By exploring key metrics and trends, the project aims to inform data-driven decisions in the healthcare sector.

Dataset
* File: healthcare_dataset.csv
* Description: This dataset contains healthcare-related data such as patient demographics, medical conditions, treatment details, and outcomes, providing a comprehensive view for analysis.

Objectives
1. The main goals of this project include:
2. Understanding patient demographics and their influence on healthcare outcomes.
3. Identifying key medical conditions and treatment patterns.
4. Analyzing resource usage and efficiency in healthcare services.

Project Structure
* Notebook: Healthcare_Analysis.ipynb
   1. Contains the code for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
   2. Walks through each step, from loading data to cleaning and exploring the dataset.
   3. Visualizations and insights are generated to support the findings.

Key Steps
1. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, data type conversions, and preparing the data for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examining distributions, trends, and patterns in the dataset to understand relationships between variables.
3. Visualization: Using plots to illustrate key insights and trends in the data, such as patient demographics, condition frequency, and healthcare outcomes.

Tools and Libraries
* Python: Primary language used for analysis.
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data manipulation and visualization).

Results
This project uncovers critical insights about patient demographics, healthcare resource allocation, and potential areas for efficiency improvement in the healthcare system.

Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open Healthcare_Analysis.ipynb and run the cells to perform the analysis.
3. Ensure the healthcare_dataset.csv file is in the same directory.

Future Work
* Deeper analysis into specific conditions or patient groups.
* Adding machine learning models to predict outcomes based on patient data.
